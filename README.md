# Watch-OS-1-Calculator
Excersize with Watch OS 1 in June 2015.
This is a simple calculator created for apple watch when it first came out.  Work is done in extension's inteface controller.swift
The challenge was that buttons in first version of watch os did not have properties such as tags that could easily be sorted with a switch statements.  Mostly deprecated by now but a good memory nontheless.
# Updated Calculator Excersize
I also made an updated version of this app for watch os 3 to use at work durring labs so I didn't have to look for one while I'm doing an experiment.  That version is in pure calcuator folder.  Updated version featured setting window as well as full iphone version.

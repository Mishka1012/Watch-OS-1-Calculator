# Watch-OS-1-Calculator
Excersize with Watch OS 1 in June 2015.
This is a simple calculator created for apple watch when it first came out.  Work is done in extension's inteface controller.swift
The challenge was that buttons in first version of watch os did not have properties such as tags that could easily be sorted with a switch statements.  Mostly deprecated by now but a good memory nontheless.
